## Augumentum
Introduction. Augumentum solve problem with finding arguments and verifying them. Augumentum is app where you can find arguments for or against some claim. All code will be open source.

You heard claim that earth is flat. You probably want to know what is this claim based on. But if you want to find arguments for flat earth your must use many hours to find them. And if you want to find arguments against these arguments that are for flat earth, it take so long time that you probably don't do it. Result is that you don't know all facts and arguments so your opinion about flat earth is based more emotions than facts. 
You can find arguments and facts from augumentum in few seconds. And all arguments and facts are in the same format and you don't know who have added these, so those things don't effect to your emotions.

### How Argumentum works?
1. User want to know answer for some question. Exapmle "Is Ethereum decentralized?"
2. If there is already topic about this, user can find easy all facts and arguments. If there isn't topic already, user can start new topic.
3. Users can also tell new arguments or facts. There will be specific standard format to arguments and facts. When you tell new argument or fact, there will automatically open new topic about if argument or fact is valid.
4.  Users who have written enough new arguments can vote good arguments up and bad arguments down.

### How blockchain add value to Augumentum?
It is very important that there are no censorship arguments. When everything is open source and data is stored on public blockchain, no one can blame us for censorship. And if you believe there is some censorship you can check it yourself.

### How blockchain will be used:
All topics, arguments and votes is stored on ethereum blockchain. Usually storing data to ethereum is expensive, but we don't store everything to bockchain. It's enough that we can prove that we show everything data that has ever been existed.

### About questions and answers/arguments:
For every argument will be opened new question/topic to speculation about if argument is true or false. If there already exists topic, then new argument is linked to there.

### Algorithms:
1. Algorithm to detect spam
2. Algorithm to regonize if there is many same questions and combine them.
3. Algorithm to recognize if there is many same answers and combine them.
4. Algorithm to recognize if there argument or fact is wrong format. 

### Voting arguments up or down:
Users that have make certain amount of arguments, can vote arguments up or down. Users will see first arguments that have most up votes and last arguments that have most down votes. Facts that arent for or against are grey. Arguments for are green. Arguments against are red.
