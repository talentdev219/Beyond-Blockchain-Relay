## Project Name
True News

## Project Summary
Instead of having a centralised platform like YouTube or Facebook attempt to filter out all news, we are trying to generate a crowd-sourced article registry that our community will curate as accurate, certified on-chain. People will also be able to upvote/downvote articles to pay journalists tokens. Identifiable curators will assess due diligence to guarantee news quality.

Following the [Token-Curated Registry](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BWWC__-Kmso9b7yCI_R7ysoGFIT9D_sfjH3axQsmB6E/edit) model, this project is about forking [HumanityDAO](https://humanitydao.org) to make two Sybil-resistant token systems where participants can vote on whether a news article is accurate or not.

- The first token is for anyone wanting to support journalists: they can upvote/downvote by staking tokens. But that doesn't solve bad journalism and sensationalists headlines. It's aimed at everyone.
- The second system will elegantly leverage curators and journalists. Only verified journalists (submitting International Press Card) can upload news.

Only unique humans (we query HumanityDAO smart contract interface to outsource this part easily) will curate news. They have reputational skin-in-the-game: you can't curate badly, because having identifiable humans is Sybil-resistant. This slightly complex system is a *prisoner dilemma with uncertain outcome*, meaning that every rational person in the network (Users, Curators, Journalists) should cooperate, hoping that the two ERC-20 token could later gain value if everyone behaves for the common good. Think of it as Patreon meets Reddit.
