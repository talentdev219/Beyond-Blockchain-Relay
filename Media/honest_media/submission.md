## Project Name
Honest Media

## Project Summary
An honest reporting platform to solve the 'Fake News' problem. Anyone can publish their content and stake on it's legitimacy . The content will be uploaded to IPFS. A Reader can challenge the authenticity of the content (with proof) and also stake on it. If the Reader wins the challenge the amount staked by the Contributor will be rewarded to him and the Validators ruling on the challenge. The Contributorâ€™s reputation rating will be affected. If the Reader loses the challenge the amount staked by the Reader will be rewarded to the Contributor and the Validators.

Credibility and reputation of the Contributor will be built by the number of upvotes and downvotes they receive and challenges lost.
