# Submitting Open Finance Bounties - Details and Instructions

## Submission Deadline
All bounty submissions must be received no later than 11:59 PM EDT on April 30th, 2019 to be considered.

## Judging Date
Projects will be assessed from May 1 to May 10th, 2019, and winners will be announced at the Ethereal Conference in New York, and then on Labs.ConsenSys.net and the Ethereal Hackathon Discord server at a later time!

## How to Submit Your Project!

### Step 1
Clone this repo to your desktop.

### Step 2
Create a branch named after your project.

### Step 2
In the repo, there is one folder for each bounty. Open the folder that corresponds with the bounty you are submitting against, and, in that folder, create a new subfolder.

### Step 3
Name the subfolder your project name.

### Step 4
Submit the following in your project's folder:
- Submission.md template
- A single file that pitches the product (video, PDF, deck)
- All supporting material (code, research, designs etc)

All submissions, including all code, must be open source for future use and reference by the community, and links to external documents must be provided in the Github repo submission.

As a reminder, we are looking for projects that address a real problem and teams that have shown the progress and entrepreneurial instincts to make something real and get it out in the world. Your application should communicate this. _The more compelling the presentation, the better your team does!_

### Step 5
Fill out the submission.md template, included at the top of the bounty's folder with all relevant information.

**This must be included to be considered for the bounty prize.**

### Step 6
Create a pull request with your team's folder submission to be merged into Master. Submit it to the repo.
