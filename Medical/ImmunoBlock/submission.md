## Project Name
ImmunoBlock

## Project Summary

* According to the American Autoimmune Related Diseases Association (AARDA) some 50 million Americans suffer from one.
* Autoimmunity is now one of the most common disease categories, ahead of cancer and heart disease.
* Autoimmune diseases are being diagnosed with such frequency that some medical experts are calling it an epidemic.

This will be a blockchain based tool to help physicians and academic researchers to gain insights into chronic inflammatory and immune conditions to calculate precisely just how much autoimmune disease has risen and where. 

Unlike cancer, autoimmune diseases do not need to be reported to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)or the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which means there’s no database to help researchers understand how many people are affected, where cases are occurring, and how quickly incidences of certain diseases are rising — all key data points for scientists trying to understand what’s happening.

The basic principle is that we will be using an Ethereum-based public ledger to store hashes to encrypted patient metadata stored on IPFS. This data contain information input by patients including their diagnoses and symptoms associated with those chronic inflammatory and autoimmune conditions. 

The patient data can be stored anonymously with only generic identifiable info such as age, gender, ethnicity to avoid privacy concerns. Since they own the data, the patient can be given read-only access to the record using a blockchain based self-sovereign identity solution - such as uPort.

The goal is to have a single store for all the data so that medical practitioners and research scientists all across the globe can gain insights and visibility into the inter-relationships connecting these similar illnesses together.
