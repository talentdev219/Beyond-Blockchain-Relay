## Desirable Data for Patients (Active Health)

## Project Summary
Patient Data is Everywhere (literally), and as of today, it is really hard to make the data useful. Yet, a great opportunity arises—-Web 3.0 + Blockchain is what Healthcare needs. We're building something big, and just need a little push for a Proof-of-Concept called Active.health—-the simpler way to manage your health.

For many patients who have visited hospitals with great care, you can set up profiles and get started with accessing your own information. The experience might be clunky and usually they don't have the electronic means to set up at the hospital so you have to take a paper home and do it yourself.

Active heath is a a smart, secure wallet that serves as a Medical ID, payment processor and source to aggregate and redistribute relevant health data so that you can find the best, efficient + affordable care, gain access to premium medications faster + cheaper, develop stronger relationships with your doctors, and to become more proactive about your health overall.
