# Healthraise.io Whitepaper v 0.1


America, [late 19th century](https://www.griffinbenefits.com/employeebenefitsblog/history_of_healthcare), the industrial revolution expanded through US cities.
Such economic innovation initiated, however, problems came with such innovations. Such work brought forth
environments for workplace injuries.

As these environments grew, [so did worker unions](https://www.griffinbenefits.com/employeebenefitsblog/history_of_healthcare).
Companies suffer losses in productivity to these incidencts, and workers suffer losses in income.
To mitigate these losses, companies began offering forms of [sickness protection to their employees](https://www.griffinbenefits.com/employeebenefitsblog/history_of_healthcare).
These sickness protection plans become the first recorded history of Healthcare within the US.

Fast forward to 2010, and expenses on health care, healthcare research, and healthcare products and
services has increased [a magnitude of 10x](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_social-problems-continuity-and-change/s16-04-problems-of-health-care-in-the.html). However 10x increase was since 1980, not the 1800s.
In 2010, healthcare brought an economy of costs of [more than $2.6 trillion USD annually](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_social-problems-continuity-and-change/s16-04-problems-of-health-care-in-the.html).
["This translates to the largest figure per capita in the industrial world."](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_social-problems-continuity-and-change/s16-04-problems-of-health-care-in-the.html)

In 2010, [16% of the US population remained uninsured](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_social-problems-continuity-and-change/s16-04-problems-of-health-care-in-the.html). And [50% of all under insurance were through an employer](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_social-problems-continuity-and-change/s16-04-problems-of-health-care-in-the.html).
Meaning, if any of those [150 million people](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/decade.2010.html) lost their job and suffered an accident, they would be in accute need for financial help.

The biggest issue in medicine isn't a needed innovation in technology. The biggest problem in medicine is financing.
Institutions researching new medical cures and technologies do their research on the funding of others.
Likewise, individuals require funding as well. In 2010, there wer [~50 million Americans](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_social-problems-continuity-and-change/s16-04-problems-of-health-care-in-the.html) without financial health coverage.

Healthraise.io offers a social platform for healthcare funding, whether it's an organization providing children chemotherapy or an individual recently laid off their job who was told they developed diabetes by their doctor.

Organizations can also be rated by individuals, as so to record incidences of medical malpractice, so individuals can choose wisely which provider to consult with their greatest need, their health.

To mitigate false reviews by part of an organization, reviews are stored on Ethereum smart contracts, as to require gas per review, in order to mitigate fradualant reviews.
Additionally, to mitigate actors impersonating accredited organizations, verified status and organization status must be passed by the owner of the contract, so no malintentioned actor can steal money by posing as an organization for fraudulant purposes.

Written reviews are stored offchain, as to alleviate costs of Ethereum storage for writing detailed reviews by members.

Healthraise funding&mdash;so you can get more health, not more burden.
