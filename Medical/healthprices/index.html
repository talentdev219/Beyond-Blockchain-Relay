      <u><h2>What is this?</h2></u>
      <h4 style="font-weight: 100;">
        HealthPrices is a comparison of health care costs from across the globe. The prices are self-reported by our users using the Ethereum blockchain. Users can filter the map by procedure types, and hover over different territories to get a sense of where they lie on the global healthcare cost scale.

      <u><h2>Why do we need this?</h2></u>
      <h4 style="font-weight: 100;">
        Transparency in healthcare costs is extremely important. According to <a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/other-publication/2006/mar/transparency-health-care-time-has-come" target="_blank">The Commonwealth Fund</a> healthcare cost transparency is essential for 3 reasons:
        <ul style="text-align: left; list-style-type: none;">
          <li><b>1.</b> To help providers improve by benchmarking their performance against others;
          <li><b>2.</b> To encourage private insurers and public programs to reward quality and efficiency; and
          <li><b>3.</b> To help patients make informed choices about their care.
        </ul>
        Just last month, President Trump <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-improving-price-quality-transparency-american-healthcare-put-patients-first/" target="_blank">signed an executive order</a> requiring hospitals to publicly post standard prices for medical care in an "easy-to-understand, consumer-friendly" format that will "allow patients to compare prices across hospitals." While this is a massive step forward for the United States, the rest of the world still is still lacking in healthcare transparency regulations.
