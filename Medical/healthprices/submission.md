## Project Summary
HealthPrices is a comparison of health care costs from across the globe. The prices shown are a mean average of data points self-reported by our users on the Ethereum blockchain. Users can filter the map by procedure types, and hover over different territories to get a sense of where they lie on the global healthcare cost scale.

#### Why do we need this?
Transparency in healthcare costs is extremely important. According to [The Commonwealth Fund](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/other-publication/2006/mar/transparency-health-care-time-has-come) healthcare cost transparency is essential for 3 reasons:

1. To help providers improve by benchmarking their performance against others;
2. To encourage private insurers and public programs to reward quality and efficiency; and
3. To help patients make informed choices about their care.

Just last month, President Trump [signed an executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-improving-price-quality-transparency-american-healthcare-put-patients-first/) requiring hospitals to publicly post standard prices for medical care in an "easy-to-understand, consumer-friendly" format that will "allow patients to compare prices across hospitals." While this is a massive step forward for the United States, the rest of the world still is still lacking in healthcare transparency regulations.

#### How will it help?
According to [a study by Notre Dame University](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/pol.20150124), customers who search for prices can save 10% to 17% on health care costs. This is monumental!
