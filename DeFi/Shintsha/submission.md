## Project Name
Shintsha

## Project Summary
We created a decentralized online market for farmers to connect with buyers and investors. Shintsha is very user-friendly and remote farmers can easily onboard themselves

Shintsha allows farmers to: 
**connect with buyers and investors via whatsapp**, 
**the farmer can register his/her farm, products** 
**upload products**, 
**view product listings**, 
**get notified when a buyer needs his services**, 
**farmers can access soft loans via a trusted rating system of kudos/NFTs which is being upvoted to the farmers profile by buyers/investors on the event of successful delivery of ordered product**.
