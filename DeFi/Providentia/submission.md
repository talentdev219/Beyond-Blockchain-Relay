## Project Name
Providentia

## Project Summary
Decentralized marketplace for student’s financing. 

Providentia aligns incentives among students, schools and investors creating a new assets class (the token) based on students’ and school performance.

The marketplace allows investors to invest in schools and students and track the investment with full transparency using the built-in credit score algorithm. The token is tradable creating a secondary market for the asset.

Schools have the incentive to focus on student’s performance in order to attract external investors.
Students are provided with a platform to select the best schools based on their performance, apply for the immediate financing and focus on finding the best job.
