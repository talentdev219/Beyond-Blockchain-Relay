## Project Summary
BlockSpy is a blockchain forensics and financial risk assessment platform that allows anyone to run a free scan on a blockchain wallet address and determine if it has been used in money laundering schemes or any other popular cryptocurrency scams. We do this by cross referencing the address’ past transactions with the daily-updated list of 2,000+ scam addresses on EtherScamDB’s GitHub.
