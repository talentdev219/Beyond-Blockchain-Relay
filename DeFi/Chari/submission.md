## Project Name

Chari: a match made in crypto

## Project Summary

Chari provides an Ethereum smart contract and UI components to support donation matching campaigns.

A new fundraiser can be created by specifying the recipient (the charity), the sponsor's refund address and an expiration time for the campaign. The sponsor deposits funds for the matching budget with a simple transfer.

A customizable fundraiser widget can easily be embedded into landing pages promoting the campaign.

Donors can contribute until expiration (also with a simple transfer, no dApp browser is required). If the budget is not fully matched when the campaign ends, the remaining budget is released to the initial sponsor. The rest is transferred to the recipient.

* Smart contract is deployed on the Ethereum mainnet as well as the Ropsten and Rinkeby testnets.
* Supports fundraisers with ETH and any ERC20 token.
* Integrates the portis.io wallet for a straightforward UX. MetaMask and other dApp browsers are supported too.
* One live fundraiser, for GiveDirectly, on mainnet with 1.25 ETH sponsorhip grant.
