          </p>
          <li className="medium-text">You can use our Kyber Swap integration <Link to="/swap">here</Link>.
            You can exchange ETH or any ERC-20 token for USDC instantly, in a few clicks.</li>
          <li className="medium-text">You can also use Kyber Network&apos;s Swap product directly at their website&nbsp;

          <p className="medium-text">If you have a Binance account, you can buy USDC easily on Binance. There are a&nbsp;

          USDC</a><ExternalLinkIcon width={10} height={10} />. Make sure you&apos;re purchasing USDC though, and not a similarly
          named token like USDT.</p>
          <p className="medium-text">You can also buy USDC easily on Coinbase, given that Coinbase helps operate and back
          USDC&apos;s reserves: </p>
            <li className="medium-text">If you prefer Coinbase Pro, it&apos;s easy to trade for USDC - you can start&nbsp;

              <ExternalLinkIcon width={10} height={10} />. Coinbase Pro is Coinbase&apos;s more advanced exchange formerly
              called GDAX. It&apos;s still owned by Coinbase, but to use it you have to attach your bank account to your
              Coinbase Pro account, or transfer crypto over from your regular Coinbase account.
            </li>
            <li className="medium-text">
              Buying directly on regular Coinbase is the easiest way to get USDC, if you already have a Coinbase account.
              You can buy it just as easily as you would buy Bitcoin or Ethereum on Coinbase, with a few clicks.
              Look below for a more detailed step-by-step guide on how to do so.
