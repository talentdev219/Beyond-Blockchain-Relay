          <h2 className="medium-text--bold">So what is Dai, exactly?</h2>
          <p className="medium-text">Dai (DAI) is a token with a stable value (thus, a <strong>stablecoin</strong>) that attempts to maintain a value of $1.00 USD. Unlike centralized stablecoins, Dai isn&apos;t backed by US dollars in a bank account. Instead, itâ€™s backed by collateral on the Maker platform. Note: if the Dai credit system is upgraded or shutdown, Dai holders may need to convert their Dai to Ethereum through the Maker platform. Read more at makerdao.com/whitepaper.

          <h2 className="medium-text--bold">How secure is DAI?</h2>
          <p className="medium-text">
            It&apos;s not always $1, it fluctuates a bit. slightly more volatil ebecause it&apos;s backed by crypto which
            is volatile. MakerDAO is the biggest project on Ethereum, has 500m or so locked up. Has a ton of audits. Seen
            as the best/interesting/promising thing on Etheruem, by far. Community support. Lot of scrutiny. Very careful to
            roll things out, testing features for 6-8 months on testnet. Largest team of an Ethereum? Lot of risk teams. WE
            trust this a lot. Flash crash of ETH, but advanced protections. Smart contract risk. Whereas for a centralized
            stablecoin like USDC, you&apos;re dealing with counterparty risk - AKA, trusting that the big company will be
            honest and secure with your money.
