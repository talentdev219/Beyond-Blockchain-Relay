        <h2 className="big-text--bold">Where can I buy Dai?</h2>
          <p className="medium-text">
            If you know what <a href="https://metamask.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Metamask</a>
            <ExternalLinkIcon width={10} height={10} /> is and have it, you may have a good idea of where to buy Dai using it:
          </p>
          <li className="medium-text">You can use our Kyber Swap integration <Link to="/swap">here</Link>.
          &nbsp;You can exchange ETH or any ERC-20 token for Dai instantly, in a few clicks.</li>
          <li className="medium-text">You can also use Kyber Network&apos;s Swap product directly at their website&nbsp;

          </li>
          <li className="medium-text">
            Unfortunately, many normal (centralized) exchanges like Binance don&apos;t have Dai, given the team behind it cares more about making Dai available on decentralized exchanges. But decentralized exchanges like IDEX offer many Dai trading pairs.
          </li>
          <p className="medium-text">
            If you don&apos;t have Metamask installed and aren&apos;t familiar with decentralized exchanges, the easiest way to get Dai
            is probably through <strong>Coinbase Pro</strong>. Coinbase Pro is Coinbase&apos;s more advanced exchange formerly called GDAX.
            It&apos;s still owned by Coinbase, but to use it you have to attach your bank account to your
            Coinbase Pro account, or transfer crypto over from your regular Coinbase account. Look below for a step-by-step guide.

        <h2 className="big-text--bold">How do I buy Dai on Coinbase?</h2>
          <p className="medium-text">1) To start off, you&apos;ll need some Ethereum to buy Dai. You can get that from wherever you want - Coinbase, Binance, Robinhood, Square, decentralized exchanges, etc.
