            <strong>Your money is safe</strong> - the ecosystem we&apos;re plugging you into has been around for almost 2 years without a single lender losing a cent of their deposits. One built-in safeguard is that people receiving your money have to put up more than the amount they borrow (150%, to be exact) as <span className="italics">just-in-case-I-can&apos;t-pay-you-back collateral</span>, which helps protect against big market dips.
