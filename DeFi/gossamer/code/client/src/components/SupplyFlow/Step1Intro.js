                Your algorithmic banker will take care of lending out chunks of your money to various borrowers. The standards to borrow are rigorous - they actually have to put up more than the amount they borrow (150%, to be exact) as <span className="italics">just-in-case-I-can&apos;t-pay-you-back collateral</span>, which makes the ecosystem quite safe.

                  <strong>Smart contracts</strong> are bits of code a developer can put on the Ethereum blockchain that sets in stone rules about what an app can and can&apos;t do.

            To be transparent, this is a dynamic number - a 30-day average of interest rates in this lending ecosystem run by Compound.

The interest rate changes based on supply and demand in the lending ecosystem, controlled by the algorithms üß†. Your interest rate goes up when more people want to borrow.
