# Judging Criteria

We are looking for projects that address a real problem and teams that have shown the progress and entrepreneurial instincts to make something real and get it out in the world.

We expect all bounties to be comprised of two distinct parts: product and potential. All submissions, including all code, must be open source for future use and reference by the community, and links to external documents must be provided in the Github repo submission.

As these bounties are broad and left up to your own discretion, we expect you to deliver the following items tailored for your specific solution:

* A specific industry, user, and use case for which you are solving
* Unique insights about the industry gathered through primary or secondary research
* Evidence of team-wide entrepreneurial behavior and spirit throughout the Relay
* Proof that the market youâ€™ve identified is primed to be disrupted in the next 6-12 months
* Testimonial from an industry Subject Matter Expert (SME) who is serving as an advisor
* Proof that blockchain adds significant value to this solution over centralized alternatives
* We are looking for participating teams to articulate both broadly and specifically how their proposed solution affects widespread industry orthodoxies. A team that delivers a specific solution must show us how this solution can be rolled out more broadly to impact the industry (or other industries) at large. Conversely, a team that solves in generalities must describe how they anticipate testing their ideas in specific, measurable experiments.
